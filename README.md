# Game-rock, paper, scissors

A mathematical model simulates the game of rock, paper, scissors. Allocate eight points to these three options, and whose final sum is greater

## Here's how to play: 

This game simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors. There are two players in total. They all have the same initial score (e.g. 8 points). They can allocate the 8 points to rock, paper, scissors arbitrarily (for example, 1 point for rock, 2 points for scissors, and 5 points for paper). The simulator then allows you, as one of the players, to choose an initial allocation method and simulate a game with another player (the other player's allocation method is random). And check the results and your probability of winning with this allocation.
The purpose is to find the best allocation method under different initial score values through testing.
